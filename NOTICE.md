## Why GPL-3.0-or-later

Every mod of this project is GPL-3.0-or-later by default (the owner, 2026-09-13). The tool is one Python file of our
own; it runs inside Mod Organizer 2's Python plugin host (`mobase`, PyQt6) and links nothing else.

## What it builds on

Mod Organizer 2 (https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer, GPL-3.0) provides the plugin API and the widgets. The
TES4 header layout it reads (MAST / SNAM subrecords) is the game's file format as documented by the community
(UESP / xEdit).
